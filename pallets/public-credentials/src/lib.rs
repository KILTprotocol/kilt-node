//! # Public credentials Pallet
//!
//! Provides means of issuing public KILT credentials to subjects, optionally on
//! request of a third-party claimer.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Attester:**: An entity which issues a set of claims (i.e., a credential)
//!   to a subject. This could be an NFT Marketplace which issues authenticity
//!   certificates to NFT collections.
//!
//! - **Claimer:**: A user that requests an attester to issue a credential to a
//!   subject, i.e., an NFT collection. The request contains the signature of
//!   the claimer, proving their involvement in the issuance process.
//!
//! - **Subject:**: The subject of a credential, i.e., the entity which the
//!   claims in the credential refer to.
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - This pallet is heavily relying on the functionalities of the `attestation`
//!   pallet for all of its functions.
//! - This pallet does not expose a `revoke` extrinsic, as revocation
//!   functionalities are entirely delegated to the `attestation` pallet.
