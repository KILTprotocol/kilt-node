//! This pallet is a core component of the Decentralized Identity Provider
//! protocol. It enables entities with an identity on a connected
//! Substrate-based chain (provider) to use those identities on the chain this
//! pallet is deployed (consumers) without requiring those entities to set up a
//! new identity locally. A consumer chain is *connected* to a provider if there
//! is a way for the consumer chain to verify state proofs about parts of the
//! state of the provider chain.

//! A cross-chain transaction with DIP assumes the entity submitting the
//! transaction has already generated a cross-chain identity commitment on the
//! provider chain, by interacting with the DIP provider pallet on the provider
//! chain. With a generated identity commitment, a cross-chain transaction flow
//! for a generic entity `A` works as follows:

//! 1. `A` generates a state proof proving the state of the identity commitment
//!    on the provider chain.
//! 2. `A` generates any additional information required for an identity proof
//!    to be successfully verified by the consumer runtime.
//! 3. `A`, using their account `AccC` on the consumer chain, calls the
//!    `dispatch_as` extrinsic by providing its identifier on the provider
//!    chain, the generated proof, and the `Call` to be dispatched on the
//!    consumer chain.
//!    1. This pallet verifies if the proof is correct, if not returns an error.
//!    2. This pallet dispatches the provided `Call` with a new origin created
//!       by this pallet, returning any errors the dispatch action returns. The
//!       origin contains the information revealed in the proof, the identifier
//!       of the acting subject and the account `AccC` dispatching the
//!       transaction.

//! The pallet is agnostic over the chain-specific definition of *identity proof
//! verifier* and *identifier*, although, when deployed, they must be configured
//! to respect the definition of identity and identity commitment established by
//! the provider this pallet is linked to.

//! For instance, if the provider establishes that an identity commitment is a
//! Merkle root of a set of public keys, an identity proof for the consumer will
//! most likely be a Merkle proof revealing a subset of those keys. Similarly,
//! if the provider defines an identity commitment as some ZK-commitment, the
//! respective identity proof on the consumer chain will be a ZK-proof verifying
//! the validity of the commitment and therefore of the revealed information.

//! For identifiers, if the provider establishes that an identifier is a public
//! key, the same definition must be used in the consumer pallet. Other definitions for an identifier, such as a simple integer or a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), must also be configured in the same way.

//! The pallet allows the consumer runtime to define some `LocalIdentityInfo`
//! associated with each identifier, which the pallet's proof verifier can
//! access and optionally modify upon proof verification. Any changes made to
//! the `LocalIdentityInfo` will be persisted if the identity proof is verified
//! correctly and the extrinsic executed successfully.

//! If the consumer does not need to store anything in addition to the
//! information an identity proof conveys, they can simply use an empty tuple
//! `()` for the local identity info. Another example could be the use of
//! signatures, which requires nonce to avoid replay protections. In this case,
//! a simple numeric type such as a `u64` or a `u128` could be used, and bumped
//! by the proof verifies when validating each new cross-chain transaction
//! proof.
