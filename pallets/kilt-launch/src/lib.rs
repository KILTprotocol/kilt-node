//! # KILT Launch Pallet
//!
//! A simple pallet providing means of setting up KILT balance locks and
//! vesting schedules for unowned accounts in the genesis block. These should
//! later be migrated to user-owned accounts via the extrinsic
//! `migrate_genesis_account` which has to be signed by a specific account
//! called `TransferAccount`. The latter is also set in the genesis block
//! and can be changed by calling the sudo extrinsic `change_transfer_account`.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The KILT Launch pallet provides functions for:
//!
//! - Setting vesting information and KILT balance lock for unowned accounts in
//!   genesis block.
//! - Migrating vesting/KILT balance lock from unowned accounts to user-owned
//!   accounts.
//! - Transfer locked tokens from user-owned account to another. NOTE: This will
//!   be made available shortly before we remove the sudo key.
//! - Forcedly (requires sudo) changing the `TransferAccount`.
//! - Forcedly (requires sudo) removing the KILT balance lock.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance
//!   until a specified block number. Multiple locks always operate over the
//!   same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack".
//!
//! - **KILT balance lock:** A Lock with a KILT specific identifier which is
//!   automatically removed when reaching the specified block number.
//!
//! - **Unowned account:** An endowed account for which potentially vesting or
//!   the KILT balance lock is set up in the genesis block.
//!
//! - **User-owned account:** A regular account which was created by an entity
//!   which wants to claim their tokens (potentially with vesting/KILT balance
//!   lock) from an unowned account.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `migrate_genesis_account` - Migrate vesting or the KILT balance lock from
//!   an unowned account to a user-owned account. Requires signature of a
//!   special account `TransferAccount` which does not have any other super
//!   powers.
//! - `migrate_multiple_genesis_accounts` - Migrate vesting or the KILT balance
//!   lock from a list of unowned accounts to the same target user-owned
//!   account. Requires signature of a special account `TransferAccount` which
//!   does not have any other super powers.
//! - `locked_transfer` - Transfer locked tokens from one user-owned account to
//!   another user-owned account. This will be made available shortly before
//!   removing the sudo key because the purpose of the lock to disable
//!   transferability of the amount.
//! - `change_transfer_account` - Change the transfer account. Can only be
//!   called by sudo.
//! - `force_unlock` - Remove all locks for a given block. Can only be called by
//!   sudo.
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! The KiltLaunch pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`].
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! * All accounts provided with balance and potentially vesting or a KILT
//!   balance lock in the genesis block are not owned by anyone and have to be
//!   migrated to accounts which are owned by users.
//! * All unowned accounts have either vesting, the KILT balance lock or neither
//!   of both. This assumption is neither checked, nor forced, nor does any code
//!   break if it does not hold true.
//! * Vesting starts at genesis block for all unowned addresses which should be
//!   migrated to user-owned accounts. This assumption is checked during
//!   migration.
//! * All KILT balance locks end at the same block for all unowned addresses
//!   which should be migrated to user-owned accounts. This assumption is
//!   checked during migration and locked transfer.
//! * The total number of accounts for which a KILT balance lock is set up is at
//!   most `MaxClaims`, for us it will be ~6. This assumption is not checked
//!   when appending to `UnlockedAt`.
