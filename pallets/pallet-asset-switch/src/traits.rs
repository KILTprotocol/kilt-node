/// Runtime-injected logic into the switch pallet around the time a switch takes
/// place.
///
/// The order in which the hooks are called, for any given local -> remote
/// switch is the following:
/// 1. `pre_local_to_remote_switch` (fallible): Called from within the switch
///    pallet before any other logic is executed. E.g., it can be used to verify
///    some requirements about the transfer.
/// 2. `post_local_to_remote_switch_dispatch` (fallible): Called from within the
///    switch pallet after all other logic is executed and after the XCM message
///    for the transfer is prepared to be sent to the remote location. E.g., it
///    can be used to update storage elements of other pallets once the transfer
///    operation is guaranteed to be sent to destination. This function can
///    still fail, in which case the message won't be sent. But otherwise, at
///    this stage the XCM message is guaranteed to at least be deliverable to
///    the destination. It can still fail at destination, which will in turn
///    call the `post_local_to_remote_transfer_revert` hook.
/// 3. `post_local_to_remote_confirmed` (infallible): Called when the remote
///    destination confirms the transfer was successful.
/// 4. `post_local_to_remote_transfer_revert` (infallible): Called when the
///    remote destination signals that a previously local -> remote switch has
///    instead failed.
///
/// The order in which the hooks are called, for any given remote -> local
/// switch is the following:
/// 1. `pre_remote_to_local_switch` (fallible): Called from the XCM components
///    handling incoming transfers representing remote -> local switches. If
///    this hook fails, the assets will most likely trap and need to be unlocked
///    manually.
/// 2. `post_remote_to_local_switch` (fallible): Same as
///    `pre_remote_to_local_switch`, but called after all the XCM logic has been
///    executed and guaranteed to be correct.
