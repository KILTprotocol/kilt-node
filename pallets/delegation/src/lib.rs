//! # Delegation Pallet
//!
//! Provides means of adding KILT delegations on chain and revoking them. Each
//! delegation is based on a specific CType. The most basic delegation is just a
//! root node to which you can add further delegations by
//! appending them to the root node resulting in a tree structure.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Claimer:**: A user which claims properties about themselves in the
//!   format of a CType. This could be a person which claims to have a valid
//!   driver's license.
//!
//! - **Attester:**: An entity which checks a user's claim and approves its
//!   validity. This could be a Citizens Registration Office which issues
//!   drivers licenses.
//!
//! - **Verifier:**: An entity which wants to check a user's claim by checking
//!   the provided attestation.
//!
//! - **CType:**: CTypes are claim types. In everyday language, they are
//!   standardised structures for credentials. For example, a company may need a
//!   standard identification credential to identify workers that includes their
//!   full name, date of birth, access level and id number. Each of these are
//!   referred to as an attribute of a credential.
//!
//! - **Attestation:**: An approved or revoked user's claim in the format of a
//!   CType.
//!
//! - **Delegation:**: An attestation which is not issued by the attester
//!   directly but via a (chain of) delegations which entitle the delegated
//!   attester. This could be an employee of a company which is authorized to
//!   sign documents for their superiors.
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - The maximum depth of a delegation tree is bounded by `MaxParentChecks`.
//!   This is not enforced when adding new delegations. However, you can only
//!   revoke up to `MaxParentChecks` many sub-delegations.
