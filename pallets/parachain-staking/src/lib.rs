//! # Parachain Staking
//!
//! A simple staking pallet providing means of selecting a set of collators to
//! become block authors based on their total backed stake. The main difference
//! between this pallet and `frame/pallet-staking` is that this pallet uses
//! direct delegation. Delegators choose exactly who they delegate and with what
//! stake. This is different from `frame/pallet-staking` where you approval vote
//! and then run Phragmen. Moreover, this pallet rewards a collator and their
//! delegators immediately when authoring a block. Rewards are calculated
//! separately between collators and delegators.
//!
//! To join the set of candidates, an account must call `join_candidates` with
//! `MinCollatorCandidateStake` <= stake <= `MaxCollatorCandidateStake`.
//!
//! To leave the set of candidates, the collator calls `leave_candidates`. If
//! the call succeeds, the collator is removed from the pool of candidates so
//! they cannot be selected for future collator sets, but they are not unstaking
//! until executing the exit request by calling the extrinsic
//! `execute_leave_candidates` at least `ExitQueueDelay` rounds later. After
//! doing so, the collator candidate as well as their delegators are unstaked.
//! Both parties then have to wait another `StakeDuration` more blocks to be
//! able to unlock their stake.
//!
//! Candidates which requested to leave can still be in the set of authors for
//! the next round due to the design of the session pallet which at the start of
//! session s(i) chooses a set for the next session s(i+1). Thus, candidates
//! have to keep collating at least until the end of the next session (= round).
//! We extend this by delaying their execute by at least `ExitQueueDelay` many
//! sessions.
//!
//! To join the set of delegators, an account must call `join_delegators` with
//! stake >= `MinDelegatorStake`. There are also runtime methods for delegating
//! additional collators and revoking delegations.
//!
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The KILT parachain staking pallet provides functions for:
//! - Joining the set of collator candidates of which the best
//!   `MaxSelectedCandidates` are chosen to become active collators for the next
//!   session. That makes the set of active collators the set of block authors
//!   by handing it over to the session and the authority pallet.
//! - Delegating to a collator candidate by staking for them.
//! - Increasing and reducing your stake as a collator or delegator.
//! - Revoking your delegation entirely.
//! - Requesting to leave the set of collator candidates.
//! - Withdrawing your unstaked balance after waiting for a certain number of
//!   blocks.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Candidate:** A user which locks up tokens to be included into the set of
//!   authorities which author blocks and receive rewards for doing so.
//!
//! - **Collator:** A candidate that was chosen to collate this round.
//!
//! - **Delegator:** A user which locks up tokens for collators they trust. When
//!   their collator authors a block, the corresponding delegators also receive
//!   rewards.
//!
//! - **Total Stake:** A collator’s own stake + the sum of delegated stake to
//!   this collator.
//!
//! - **Total collator stake:** The sum of tokens locked for staking from all
//!   collator candidates.
//!
//! - **Total delegator stake:** The sum of tokens locked for staking from all
//!   delegators.
//!
//! - **To Stake:** Lock tokens for staking.
//!
//! - **To Unstake:** Unlock tokens from staking.
//!
//! - **Round (= Session):** A fixed number of blocks in which the set of
//!   collators does not change. We set the length of a session to the length of
//!   a staking round, thus both words are interchangeable in the context of
//!   this pallet.
//!
//! - **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance
//!   until a specified block number. Multiple locks always operate over the
//!   same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack"
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//! - `set_inflation` - Change the inflation configuration. Requires sudo.
//! - `set_max_selected_candidates` - Change the number of collator candidates
//!   which can be selected to be in the set of block authors. Requires sudo.
//! - `set_blocks_per_round` - Change the number of blocks of a round. Shorter
//!   rounds enable more frequent changes of the selected candidates, earlier
//!   unlockal from unstaking and earlier collator leaving. Requires sudo.
//! - `increase_max_candidate_stake_by` - Increase the maximum amount which can
//!   be staked by a collator candidate.
//! - `decrease_max_candidate_stake_by` - Decrease the maximum amount which can
//!   be staked by a collator candidate.
//! - `join_candidates` - Join the set of collator candidates by staking at
//!   least `MinCandidateStake` and at most `MaxCollatorCandidateStake`.
//! - `init_leave_candidates` - Request to leave the set of collators. Unstaking
//!   and storage clean-up is delayed until executing the exit at least
//!   ExitQueueDelay rounds later.
//! - `candidate_stake_more` - Increase your own stake as a collator candidate
//!   by the provided amount up to `MaxCollatorCandidateStake`.
//! - `candidate_stake_less` - Decrease your own stake as a collator candidate
//!   by the provided amount down to `MinCandidateStake`.
//! - `join_delegators` - Join the set of delegators by delegating to a collator
//!   candidate.
//! - `delegate_another_candidate` - Delegate to another collator candidate by
//!   staking for them.
//! - `leave_delegators` - Leave the set of delegators and revoke all
//!   delegations. Since delegators do not have to run a node and cannot be
//!   selected to become block authors, this exit is not delayed like it is for
//!   collator candidates.
//! - `revoke_delegation` - Revoke a single delegation to a collator candidate.
//! - `delegator_stake_more` - Increase your own stake as a delegator and the
//!   delegated collator candidate's total stake.
//! - `delegator_stake_less` - Decrease your own stake as a delegator and the
//!   delegated collator candidate's total stake by the provided amount down to
//!   `MinDelegatorStake`.
//! - `unlock_unstaked` - Attempt to unlock previously unstaked balance from any
//!   account. Succeeds if at least one unstake call happened at least
//!   `StakeDuration` blocks ago.
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! The KiltLaunch pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`].
//!
//! ## Assumptions+
//!
//! - At the start of session s(i), the set of session ids for session s(i+1)
//!   are chosen. These equal the set of selected candidates. Thus, we cannot
//!   allow collators to leave at least until the start of session s(i+2).
