//! # DID Pallet
//!
//! Provides W3C-compliant DID functionalities. A DID identifier is derived from
//! a KILT address and must be verifiable, i.e., must be able to generate
//! digital signatures that can be verified starting from a raw payload, its
//! signature, and the signer identifier. Currently, the DID pallet supports the
//! following types of keys: Ed25519, Sr25519, and Ecdsa for signing keys, and
//! X25519 for encryption keys.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Origin`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! Each DID identifier is mapped to a set of keys, which in KILT are used for
//! different purposes.
//!
//! - One **authentication key**: used to sign and authorise DID-management
//!   operations (e.g., the update of some keys or the deletion of the whole
//!   DID). This is required to always be present as otherwise the DID becomes
//!   unusable since no operation signature can be verified anymore.
//!
//! - Zero or more **key agreement keys**: used by other parties that want to
//!   interact with the DID subject to perform ECDH and encrypt information
//!   addressed to the DID subject.
//!
//! - Zero or one **delegation key**: used to sign and authorise the creation of
//!   new delegation nodes on the KILT blockchain. In case no delegation key is
//!   present, the DID subject cannot write new delegations on the KILT
//!   blockchain. For more info, check the [delegation
//!   pallet](../../delegation/).
//!
//! - Zero or one **attestation key**: used to sign and authorise the creation
//!   of new attested claims on the KILT blockchain. In case no attestation key
//!   is present, the DID subject cannot write new attested claims on the KILT
//!   blockchain. For more info, check the [attestation
//!   pallet](../../attestation/).
//!
//! - A set of **public keys**: includes at least the previous keys in addition
//!   to any past attestation key that has been rotated but not entirely
//!   revoked.
//!
//! - An optional **service endpoints description**: pointing to the description
//!   of the services the DID subject exposes and storing a cryptographic hash
//!   of that information to ensure the integrity of the content.
//!  For more information, check the W3C DID Core specification.
//!
//! - A **transaction counter**: acts as a nonce to avoid replay or signature
//!   forgery attacks. Each time a DID-signed transaction is executed, the
//!   counter is incremented.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `create` - Register a new DID on the KILT blockchain under the given DID
//!   identifier.
//! - `update` - Update any keys or the service endpoints of an existing DID.
//! - `delete` - Delete the specified DID and all related keys from the KILT
//!   blockchain.
//! - `submit_did_call` - Proxy a dispatchable function for an extrinsic that
//!   expects a DID origin. The DID pallet verifies the signature and the nonce
//!   of the wrapping operation and then dispatches the underlying extrinsic
//!   upon successful verification.
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - The maximum number of new key agreement keys that can be specified in a
//!   creation or update operation is bounded by `MaxNewKeyAgreementKeys`.
//! - The maximum number of new keys that can be deleted in an update operation
//!   is bounded by `MaxVerificationKeysToRevoke`.
//! - The maximum number of endpoint URLs for a new DID service description is
//!   bounded by `MaxEndpointUrlsCount`.
//! - The maximum length in ASCII characters of any endpoint URL is bounded by
//!   `MaxUrlLength`.
//! - The chain performs basic checks over the endpoint URLs provided in
//!   creation and deletion operations. The SDK will perform more in-depth
//!   validation of the URL string, e.g., by pattern-matching using regexes.
