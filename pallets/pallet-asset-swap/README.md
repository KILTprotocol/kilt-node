# TODO

Besides the TODOs in the code, the following points must be tackled (ordered by importance):
* [REQUIRED FOR V2] Add hook to check the swap parameters (restricting where remote assets can be sent to).
* [REQUIRED FOR V2] Add constraints about which beneficiary people can send their tokens to.
* [REQUIRED FOR V2] Improve logging, also for cases other than errors. Check how XCM implements them.
* [OPTIONAL] Add configurable ratio for local/remote swaps.
