//! Pallet to store namespaced deposits for the configured `Currency`. It allows

//! optionally perform related actions somewhere else in the runtime.
//! Each deposit is identified by a namespace and a key. There cannot be two
//! equal keys under the same namespace, but the same key can be present under
//! different namespaces.
