//! # Attestation Pallet
//!
//! Provides means of adding KILT attestations on chain and revoking them.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Claimer:**: A user which claims properties about themselves in the
//!   format of a CType. This could be a person which claims to have a valid
//!   driver's license.
//!
//! - **Attester:**: An entity which checks a user's claim and approves its
//!   validity. This could be a Citizens Registration Office which issues
//!   drivers licenses.
//!
//! - **Verifier:**: An entity which wants to check a user's claim by checking
//!   the provided attestation.
//!
//! - **CType:**: CTypes are claim types. In everyday language, they are
//!   standardised structures for credentials. For example, a company may need a
//!   standard identification credential to identify workers that includes their
//!   full name, date of birth, access level and id number. Each of these are
//!   referred to as an attribute of a credential.
//!
//! - **Attestation:**: An approved or revoked user's claim in the format of a
//!   CType.
//!
//! - **Delegation:**: An attestation which is not issued by the attester
//!   directly but via a (chain of) delegations which entitle the delegated
//!   attester. This could be an employe of a company which is authorized to
//!   sign documents for their superiors.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//! - `add` - Create a new attestation for a given claim which is based on a
//!   CType. The attester can optionally provide a reference to an existing
//!   delegation that will be saved along with the attestation itself in the
//!   form of an attested delegation.
//! - `revoke` - Revoke an existing attestation for a given claim. The revoker
//!   must be either the creator of the attestation being revoked or an entity
//!   that in the delegation tree is an ancestor of the attester, i.e., it was
//!   either the delegator of the attester or an ancestor thereof.
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - The claim which shall be attested is based on a CType and signed by the
//!   claimer.
//! - The Verifier trusts the Attester. Otherwise, the attestation is worthless
//!   for the Verifier
