//! # Delegated Election Module.
//!
//! An election module based on direct delegations.
//!
//! ### Term and Round
//!
//! The election happens in _rounds_: every `N` blocks, all previous members are
//! retired and a new set is elected (which may or may not have an intersection
//! with the previous set). Each round lasts for some number of blocks defined
//! by [`Config::TermDuration`]. The words _term_ and _round_ can be used
//! interchangeably in this context.
//!
//! [`Config::TermDuration`] might change during a round. This can shorten or
//! extend the length of the round. The next election round's block number is
//! never stored but rather always checked on the fly. Based on the current
//! block number and [`Config::TermDuration`], the condition `BlockNumber %
//! TermDuration == 0` being satisfied will always trigger a new election round.
//!
//! ### Bonds and Deposits
//!
//! Both voting and being a candidate requires deposits to be taken, in exchange
//! for the data that needs to be kept on-chain. The terms *bond* and *deposit*
//! can be used interchangeably in this context.
//!
//! Bonds will be unreserved only upon adhering to the protocol laws. Failing to
//! do so will cause in the bond to slashed.
//!
//! ### Voting
//!
//! Voters can vote for a limited number of the candidates by providing a list
//! of account ids, bounded by [`MAXIMUM_VOTE`]. Invalid votes (voting for
//! non-candidates) and duplicate votes are ignored during election. Yet, a
//! voter _might_ vote for a future candidate. Voters reserve a bond
//! as they vote. Each vote defines a `value`. This amount is locked from the
//! account of the voter and indicates the weight of the vote. Voters can update
//! their votes at any time by calling `vote()` again. This can update the vote
//! targets (which might update the deposit) or update the vote's stake
//! ([`Voter::stake`]). After a round, votes are kept and might still be valid
//! for further rounds. A voter is responsible for calling `remove_voter` once
//! they are done to have their bond back and remove the lock.
//!
//! See [`Call::vote`], [`Call::remove_voter`].
//!
//! ### Defunct Voter
//!
//! A voter is defunct once all of the candidates that they have voted for are
//! not a valid candidate (as seen further below, members and runners-up are
//! also always candidates). Defunct voters can be removed via a root call
//! ([`Call::clean_defunct_voters`]). Upon being removed, their bond is
//! returned. This is an administrative operation and can be called only by the
//! root origin in the case of state bloat.
//!
//! ### Candidacy and Members
//!
//! Candidates also reserve a bond as they submit candidacy. A candidate can end
//! up in one of the below situations:
//!   - **Members**: A winner is kept as a _member_. They must still have a bond
//!     in reserve and they are automatically counted as a candidate for the
//!     next election. The number of desired members is set by
//!     [`Config::DesiredMembers`].
//!   - **Runner-up**: Runners-up are the best candidates immediately after the
//!     winners. The number of runners up to keep is set by
//!     [`Config::DesiredRunnersUp`]. Runners-up are used, in the same order as
//!     they are elected, as replacements when a candidate is kicked by
//!     [`Call::remove_member`], or when an active member renounces their
//!     candidacy. Runners are automatically counted as a candidate for the next
//!     election.
//!   - **Loser**: Any of the candidate who are not member/runner-up are left as
//!     losers. A loser might be an _outgoing member or runner-up_, meaning that
//!     they are an active member who failed to keep their spot. **An outgoing
//!     candidate/member/runner-up will always lose their bond**.
//!
//! #### Renouncing candidacy.
//!
//! All candidates, elected or not, can renounce their candidacy. A call to
//! [`Call::renounce_candidacy`] will always cause the candidacy bond to be
//! refunded.
//!
//! Note that with the members being the default candidates for the next round
//! and votes persisting in storage, the election system is entirely stable
//! given no further input. This means that if the system has a particular set
//! of candidates `C` and voters `V` that lead to a set of members
//! `M` being elected, as long as `V` and `C` don't remove their candidacy and
//! votes, `M` will keep being re-elected at the end of each round.
//!
