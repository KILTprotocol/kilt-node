//! # CType Pallet
//!
//! A simple pallet which enables users to store their CType hash (blake2b as
//! hex string) on chain and associate it with their account id.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **CType:**: CTypes are claim types. In everyday language, they are
//!   standardised structures for credentials. For example, a company may need a
//!   standard identification credential to identify workers that includes their
//!   full name, date of birth, access level and id number. Each of these are
//!   referred to as an attribute of a credential.
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - The CType hash was created using our KILT JS-SDK.
//! - The underlying CType includes only the following required fields for the
//!   JSON-Schema we use in the SDK: Identifier, KILT specific JSON-Schema,
//!   Title and Properties.
